Redux 

Motivation: 
* JavaScript SPAs becoming more and more complex
* Application/UI state becomes more complex
* Losing control over complex state changes
-> Make state mutations predictable!

reducer(state, action) -> nextState

MobX

Not opinionated on how the state should be updated,
only takes care that the relevant UI parts are updated if the state changes

@observable, @observer annotations
